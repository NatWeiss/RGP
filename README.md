Docco
-----

**Docco** is a quick-and-dirty documentation generator, written in
[Literate CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#literate).
It produces an HTML document that displays your comments intermingled with your
code. All prose is passed through
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and code is
passed through [Highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/) syntax highlighting.
This page is the result of running Docco against its own
[source file](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco/blob/master/docco.litcoffee).

1. Install Docco with **npm**: `sudo npm install -g docco`

2. Run it against your code: `docco src/*.coffee`

There is no "Step 3". This will generate an HTML page for each of the named
source files, with a menu linking to the other pages, saving the whole mess
into a `docs` folder (configurable).

The [Docco source](http://github.com/jashkenas/docco) is available on GitHub,
and is released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Docco can be used to process code written in any programming language. If it
doesn't handle your favorite yet, feel free to
[add it to the list](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco/blob/master/resources/languages.json).
Finally, the ["literate" style](http://coffeescript.org/#literate) of *any*
language is also supported â€” just tack an `.md` extension on the end:
`.coffee.md`, `.py.md`, and so on.
