	/** \class CCUpgradeVG
		\brief An upgrade virtual good is one VG in a series of VGs that define an upgrade scale of an associated VirtualGood.
	 
		This type of virtual good is best explained with an example:
		Lets say you have a strength attribute to your character in the game and that strength is on the scale 1-5.
		You want to provide your users with the ability to upgrade that strength. This is what you'll need to create:
		1. SingleUseVG for 'strength'
		2. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 1'
		3. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 2'
		4. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 3'
		5. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 4'
		6. UpgradeVG for strength 'level 5'
	 
		Now, when the user buys this UpgradeVG, we check and make sure the appropriate conditions are met and buy it for you
		(which actually means we upgrading the associated VirtualGood).
