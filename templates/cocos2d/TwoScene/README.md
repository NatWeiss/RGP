  Congratulations on creating a Cocos2D JS game!
  Run it by opening the Xcode project in `Projects`.
  Or, by running `Server/run` and browsing to: http://localhost:8000
  Or, by running `cd Projects/android && make && make run`
  Ready to code? Start with the `Assets/GameScene.js` file.
  Do `rapidgame prebuild` to get the latest Cocos2D JS.
