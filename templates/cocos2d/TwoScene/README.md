Congratulations on creating a Cocos2D JS game!

To run your game just open the Xcode project in the proj.ios_mac directory and run.

Start customizing your game by editing the js/GameScene.js file.

You can also run the HTML5 version. First start the server:

	cd MyGame
	./run-server

Then browse to http://localhost:8000/ to play.

You can also run the Android version:

	cd MyGame/proj.android
	make && make run
