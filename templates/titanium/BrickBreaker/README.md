The game contained in this directory will run **as is**. It's a fully functional Breakout clone and does not require any dependencies.


Background
----------

This game originally started as preparation for a blog post published on Binpress called [Selecting a Cross-platform Game Engine](http://www.binpress.com/blog/2014/05/14/selecting-cross-platform-game-engine/).

In order to accurately compare and contrast the game engines, I wrote a Breakout clone from scratch using each one. After completing the Breakout clones, I decided to release them on Github by re-purposing them slightly and making them [RapidGame](http://wizardfu.com/rapidgame) templates.
