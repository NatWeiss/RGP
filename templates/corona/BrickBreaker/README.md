This game originally started as preparation for a blog post published on Binpress called [Selecting a Cross-platform Game Engine](http://www.binpress.com/blog/2014/05/14/selecting-cross-platform-game-engine/).

In order to accurately compare and contrast the game engines, I wrote a Breakout clone from scratch using each one. After completing the Breakout clones, I decided to release them Github. They are made freely available as [RapidGame](http://wizardfu.com/rapidgame) templates.

To quickly create your own Breakout clone for Corona:

	sudo npm install rapidgame -g
	rapidgame MyGame -e corona -t BrickBreaker -k com.mycompany.mygame
