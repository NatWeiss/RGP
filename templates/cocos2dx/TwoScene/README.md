  Congratulations on creating a cocos2d-x game!
  Run it by opening the Xcode project in `Projects`.
  Or on windows, by opening the `.sln` file in `Projects\windows`.
  Or, by running `cd Projects/android && make && make run`
  Ready to code? Start with the `Projects/GameScene.cpp` file.
  Do `rapidgame prebuild` to prepare cocos2d-x libraries.
